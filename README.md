# Team-Profile-Generator

## Description
The goal of this challenge was build a Node.js command-line application that takes in information about employees on a software engineering team and generates an HTML webpage that displays summaries for each person. I received the test files from the instructional staff. For this project, I used Inquirer for the prompts and Jest to run the tests.
